                                  Mobile App project Movie Recycler 

 

Abstract: 

On this lab we are required to work and apply our knowledge in recycler view, where it will be creating a recycler card view and details about at least four movies. Some of the requirements such as number of seats and seats remaining, and its details will be reported here. 

Introduction: 

Recycler view is a good way to simplify our project in our mobile app, but what is a RecyclerView in Android Studio? RecyclerView is the View Group that contains the views corresponding to your data. Itâ€™s a view itself, so you add RecyclerView into your layout the way you would add any other UI element. After the view holder is created, the RecyclerView binds it to its data. You define the view holder by extending RecyclerView. In Recyclerview you can work with arrays making a list of pictures and names, this is an easier way to develop our projects. In this project we need to work on our App very carefully, once that it involves a lot of new concepts to reach our goals, so I will talk a little more with more details about this project. 

 

Procedures / Results 

As I mentioned previously this second project involves new concepts for me in an android studio, so I needed to see some tutorial to help me to develop some of these tasks to understand a little more how RecyclerView works. For this project I created for class and four movies, after that I started to connect my class and create my layout, in main class I created arrays, arrays to input certain information's such as the name of the movies and pictures. To do the second part I got some issues, for example, I find it very hard to find a way to set up the seats and the seats remaining as well as the information on the new activity, it took a lot of time to find a solution for it works pretty well. I could find a solution to implements the information in my array, and to put the seats remaining, but some procedures were not working as it should work, for example: the section that I put to select seat it is working but not properly as I would want, I got some issues, and then I did some research but could not find a way to fix it, it was the hardest part of the assignment but I could work in my cold and I could do some improvements, and then I find the right solutions my project works. 

 Conclusion: 

This was a challenge project where we are required to put everything that we have Learned so far. On this activity spatially android studio, we have to have good research and try to minimize all issues that we face, when we try to develop our project. This project was done in Kotlin language where the developer can find some contents on some particular web sites to help to create each section. All this work mentioned in this report was based in a recyclerView card where the developer chose movie pictures and collected pieces of information for this assessment.
